# Hill-Climbing-Search-Simulated-Annealing-Local-Beam-Search

Task 1:
A salesman is required to visit a number of cities during a trip. The salesman needs to find the
shortest route that takes him to each destination exactly once. With a map of streets and locations,
the challenge is to plan the optimal route, minimizing travel time and distance. To tackle this
challenge, the salesman decides to use any efficient algorithm.
Representing the cities by vertices and roads between them by edges there is a graph in figure 1.

For this task you should create an array using numpy library, it should be a 2D array, the values
should be:

The graph in figure 1 is generated from these values. These values are the latitude and longitude
for the citiesâ€™ location.
Use this graph to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem using simple Hill Climbing, Hill
Climbing variants (First Search, Random Restart, Stochastic), also apply simulated annealing and
local beam search to analyze the difference between these search algorithms.
Calculate time and space complexity of each algorithm.
Find the complete path and create a graph for this path using networkx library.
